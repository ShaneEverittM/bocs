# Orbit counting based on Count-Min-Sketch
Paper :https://dsf.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/countmin-latin2004.pdf


# Problem
Explain the counting problem, with memory problems from the Prof's emails

# Motivation
Wanted to try a non-traditional approach with probabilistic data structure. Promises of sub-linear memory

# Data Structure design

1. About hash functions.
1. Explain the depth and width and the constraints they apply 

# Pseudocode


# Results

1. Memory usage graph. Theoritical vs Practical
1. Show that e=7 gets almost very accurate values for the given inputs and why
1. Try different e values for k=4, to show how the values vary within a range

# Hypothesis

We believe that even though we have less accuracy, we know the bounds and we can sacrifice accuracy for approximation and still have predictive value. Couldn't test this hypothesis as we didn't have access to prediction logic.
